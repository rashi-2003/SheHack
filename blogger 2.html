                <h3 class="title">Reflections on turning 34</h3>
                <p>The truth is that at 34, I’m having a hard time trying to find the 23-year-old me who first began
                    penning this blog. She lived for the road, wouldn’t think twice about saying yes to a journey to the
                    other side of the globe, and never dwelled
                    enough on the future. There might still be roads left in my shoes, but my feet are weary of where
                    they tread and the trail they leave behind. Some might call it climate anxiety, but I think of it as
                    impact anxiety. I constantly wonder
                    about the impact of my travels – and existence – on this planet I’m lucky to call home… and even
                    enrolled in a course to use scientific tools to be able to calculate it via a Life Cycle Assessment
                    (more on that later). The pandemic,
                    in all its weird and twisted ways, has me convinced that I can no longer just be a messenger –
                    author, travel writer, blogger, Instagrammer, what have you. To that end, I’ve now begun consulting
                    an international travel company to assess
                    the life cycle impact of their trips, figure out how to minimize their carbon emissions and
                    ecosystem impact, and develop insetting projects to get to carbon neutral (or negative). I’m also
                    contributing to a climate adaptation research
                    project with tourism resilience at its core, and here on Robinson Crusoe over the coming month, I
                    hope to engage with the island community in building a sustainable tourism destination. A
                    20-something girl set out to defy societal
                    expectations by travelling solo, living out of two bags as a digital nomad, challenging conventions
                    of marriage and kids, and questioning the deeper purpose of travel. At 34, I feel ready to shed her
                    skin and find new unknowns to tread.
                    I’ve spent the entire pandemic oscillating between feeling rootless, and feeling ready to restart my
                    digital nomad life. But each time I wonder if the lure of the road is finally fading, it whips out
                    its magic wand and casts its spell
                    on me. One thing is for sure though: At 34, I’m no longer just a girl who travels.a refreshing swim.
                    Every few moments, a wave would roll in and pull away the sand from under my feet, no matter how
                    tightly I tried to hold on to it.
                    Gradually, I conceded to the waves and stopped resisting. I think that feeling kind of sums up life
                    during the pandemic. I suppose we each tried to maintain some illusion of control over our lives,
                    travels, work and other plans, but
                    ultimately had no choice but to let go. As a long term traveller and travel writer, it has been two
                    mentally and financially challenging years. Yet I’m immensely grateful that my family and friends
                    are in good health, and those who
                    did succumb to Covid-19 have recovered. I know not everyone has been so lucky. If you’ve suffered,
                    or lost a loved one, I hope you’ll find the strength to get through this difficult time. My heart is
                    with you. In the midst of this
                    storm, I’ve been learning to readjust my sails. As I tried to stay afloat, some bittersweet
                    realizations dawned on me. Lessons that I perhaps overlooked during the past decade of a (digitally)
                    nomadic existence:

                <h3 class="title">Turning 34 in Quarantine in the Middle of the Pacific Ocean.</h3>
                <p>But little did I know what was still in store… On our fifth morning on the island, we headed out to
                    the small village hospital for our fourth covid test of the trip. For the first time, I saw the only
                    street of our village, the Lenovo
                    technology hub where we’d have access to high speed wifi, and the family-run restaurant from where
                    our food was catered. The air smelt like the ocean; the ocean shone a brilliant blue like the sky.
                    Our squad of four, who’d shared the
                    disappointment of flight delays and thrill of boarding that tiny plane, bustled with excitement as
                    we awaited the rapid test results. But as the clouds covered the sun and the wind started blowing
                    hard, the room suddenly turned gloomy.
                    The island nurse announced, quite ominously, that one person had tested positive – and as close
                    contacts, the rest of us would have to quarantine for three more nights! An ambulance awaited
                    outside the hospital to ferry us back the
                    few hundred meters – and as news got around, the entire island went into a voluntary lockdown for 24
                    hours. As I retreated back to my cozy wooden studio, overlooking the now silvery-blue waters of the
                    Pacific Ocean, the sun cast a
                    strange halo on the wind-swept cliffs that rose up from the water. My eyes welled up with tears, as
                    I craved to connect with my partner but had no internet to do so.

                <p>
                    The plan sounded quite alright. Upon landing in Chile, I would spend five nights in quarantine in
                    Valparaiso and four on the island and be let out just before my 34th birthday, to embrace the
                    spectacular beauty and connect with the remote island community
                    of Robinson Crusoe Island. But plans never work like they`re supposed to, do they? Our tiny plane
                    from mainland Chile to Robinson Crusoe Island got rescheduled three times. Each time, disappointed
                    and desperate, I retreated to an extended,
                    isolating quarantine in Room 1217 where the walls felt like theWhen the stars finally aligned, I was
                    surprised to be dropped off at a navy airstrip in the wilderness of Santiago, the capital city of
                    Chile! A tiny six-seater plane waited
                    to carry four of us, along with two pilots, who proudly told us that that plane has been flying
                    since the 1970s, manufactured some 50 years ago. Its scratched windows and broken air conditioning
                    ducts were evidence. I soon learnt that
                    things had been quite lax until a few years ago when a famous Chilean actor died in a plane crash on
                    his way to the island. Safety became of the utmost concern thereafter – and I’m so glad we waited
                    for just the right weather conditions!
                    At low altitude above the Pacific Ocean, we flew for about two hours, hearts partly in our mouths.
                    Descending past mist-engulfed hills and roaring waters, we landed on a narrow airstrip plucked out
                    of the moon, surrounded by desolate
                    landscapes streaked orange and brown. Around the small airport jetty where we waited to board the
                    boat to San Juan Bautista – the only inhabited village on the island – hundreds of seals swam and
                    pranced about in the water. The choppy
                    boat ride took us past Jurassic Park-esque scenery, finally depositing us ashore for four days of
                    island quarantine
